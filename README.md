# Music and Mental Health â€“ Statistical Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project was created as part of the course Statistical Data Analysis in the third year of undergraduate studies. The analysis was conducted using RStudio, focusing on exploring the relationship between music preferences and mental health.

## Project Motivation
Music therapy (MT) is a recognized method that utilizes music and its elements to reduce stress, improve mood, and support overall mental well-being. It acts as a catalyst for the release of "happiness hormones" like oxytocin. Music therapy includes a broad range of genres, and preferences can vary significantly depending on individual or organizational context. Research, education, and clinical practice in MT rely on professional standards, while also considering cultural, social, and political backgrounds.

This project aims to explore how musical preferences and listening habits may be related to self-assessed mental health metrics, based on data collected through a public survey.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 736 responses gathered via an online survey. It includes 33 variables, such as:

- Age of respondents
- Whether they are instrumentalists and/or composers
- Streaming service used
- Listening habits while working
- Preference for foreign-language music
- Exploration of new music
- Average daily listening time

## Research Questions
Research Questions

The following research questions guided the analysis:

- Do composers listen to more music daily compared to others?
- What are the correlations between genre listening frequency and self-assessed mental health issues?
- Is the correlation between metal genre listening and depression statistically significant?
- Is there a connection between the streaming service used and the tendency to explore new music?
- Does the average listening time vary significantly depending on the respondent's favorite genre?
- Is it possible to predict the respondent's age using the available data?
